/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global binding: the `this` value will be the window/console Object. Avoid this.
* 2. Implicit binding: when it's a method, the `this` value is the Object in which the method is applied to.
* 3. Explicit binding: when call, apply, or bind is used (those specific methods), `this` is explicitly defined.
* 4. New binding: when constructor function is used, `this` is referring to what's returned by the constructor function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
